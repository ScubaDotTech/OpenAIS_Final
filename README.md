Machine Learning for Zebra Muscle Prediction In Candlewood Lake, CT. 



This project investigates how invasive species—particularly aquatic plants and the emerging zebra mussel threat—have developed in Candlewood Lake between 2007 and 2020. By constructing multiple tree based machine learning models, our 
organization's goal is to provide actionable insights for conservation and monitoring, supporting Scuba.Tech’s collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP).

Objectives

Analyze historical invasive species trends (e.g., Eurasian watermilfoil, minor naiad).

Integrate zebra mussel research to identify conditions favorable for colonization.

Forecast invasive species spread and zebra mussel hotspots for 2025.

Methods

Data Preparation: Organize survey data on plant occurrence, abundance, depth, and substrate types; incorporate zebra mussel sightings.

Visualization: Produce GIS maps and animated time-series (GIFs) showing species spread, annotated with key ecological events.

Zebra Mussel Research: Examine environmental preferences (water chemistry, substrate, temperature) to locate high-risk areas.

Predictive Analysis: Use statistical models to forecast 2025 invasion patterns by overlaying species data with zebra mussel habitat preferences.

Deliverables

Animated GIF of invasive species and zebra mussel spread (2007–2020).

Predictive 2025 map of invasive plants and zebra mussel risk zones.

Summary report with findings, trends, and monitoring recommendations.
