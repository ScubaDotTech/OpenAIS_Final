# Machine Learning for Zebra Muscle Prediction In Candlewood Lake, CT. 
![Alt text](scuba.tech.png)


This project investigates how invasive species such as Eurasian Watermilfoil and the Zebra mussel have developed in Candlewood Lake between 2007 and 2020. By constructing multiple tree based machine learning models, our 
organization's goal is to provide actionable insights for conservation and monitoring, supporting Scuba.Tech’s collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP).

## Methods

- Utilize Optical Character Recognition alongside manual spot-cleaning to transform pdf records of species data into structured csv files.

- Integrate zebra mussel research to identify conditions favorable for colonization.

- Applied supervised machine learning forecasting with a random forest regression model to generate out-of-sample predictions of zebra mussel population growth and extend the time-series dataset

- Built a classification random forest model to accurately estimate and map high-risk locations for zebra mussel colonization.
